# EmailAutomationProject
A lightweight Java-based utility built to assist organizations in automating employee account creation. The system generates professional email IDs and strong passwords through a user-friendly console interface and is cloud-hosted for accessibility and monitoring.

The system simplifies employee onboarding by automatically creating email usernames from user-provided names while preventing duplication when employees share similar names. It also produces secure password combinations and stores employee records for quick retrieval and display. The entire application is deployed on AWS infrastructure for better availability and performance tracking.
